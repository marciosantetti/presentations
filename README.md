# Presentations repository

In this repository, you may find diverse materials from my presentations.

The slide decks are generated using the fantastic `xaringan` R package. 

The base slide template is inspired by [Ed Rubin's](https://github.com/edrubin) awesome lecture notes.

For any clarifications and/or suggestions, contact me via email.
